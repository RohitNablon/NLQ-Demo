An SVP of AI Strategy doesn't want to see what your platform does - they want to see the business transformation it enables. Your current dashboard shows technical metrics (queries executed, response time) but lacks the strategic narrative that executives use to justify AI investments to boards and stakeholders.
What SVPs Care About:

ROI & Business Impact: Hard dollars saved, revenue generated, productivity gains
Adoption & Change Management: How fast users embrace it (proxy for organizational readiness)
Risk Mitigation: Governance, compliance, accuracy (especially in Retail/CPG with tight margins)
Competitive Differentiation: How this enables capabilities competitors don't have
Scalability: Can this grow from pilot to enterprise-wide deployment?

SECTION 6: OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
AI-Generated Platform Improvements
📋 Suggested Optimizations (Generated by Platform AI)

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Semantic Layer Gap - Store Operations Domain
   Issue: Only 62% coverage causing 34% of failed queries from Store Ops team
   Impact: $47K/month in lost productivity  
   Recommendation: Add 23 missing entities (store formats, traffic patterns, labor scheduling)
   Effort: 2 weeks | ROI: $564K annually
   
2. Query Performance - Large Table Scans
   Issue: 12% of queries on Inventory DB taking >5s due to missing indexes
   Impact: User frustration, reduced adoption
   Recommendation: Add composite indexes on [product_id, location_id, date]
   Effort: 1 day | Performance improvement: 78% faster

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
3. User Training Gap - Finance Department
   Issue: 68% adoption vs 85% target, high failed query rate (14%)
   Impact: $23K/month in unrealized value
   Recommendation: Department-specific training + curated question library
   Effort: 2 weeks | Expected adoption lift: +17%

4. Knowledge Graph Enhancement - Product Hierarchy
   Issue: 18% of queries fail to correctly navigate category → subcategory → SKU
   Impact: Incorrect aggregations in category analysis
   Recommendation: Refine product taxonomy with subject matter expert review
   Effort: 1 week | Accuracy improvement: +4.2%

LOW PRIORITY:
5. Visualization Variety
   Issue: 89% of charts are bar/line, users requesting more diversity
   Impact: Engagement opportunity
   Recommendation: Add treemap, sankey, sunburst chart options
   Effort: 1 week | User satisfaction lift: +0.3 points
